A learn project for Airflow and usage of the docker for Airflow on Windows


Goals:
    Docker:
        - understand how to use docker image for airflow,
        - run airflow in the docker image,
        - customize extending of the image with new packages to install,


Goals:
    Airflow:
        - create several tasks with different operators,
        - first task: uploading podcasts
        - second task: create table and columns with Sqlite3
        - run tasks in the AirFlow UI


NOTES:
    - To install and configure docker for the project, please read instructions
    - sqlite table is not updated as a docker container was not customized to communicate with the internal db (it should be done in the future)
